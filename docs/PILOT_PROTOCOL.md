# Pilot Protocol (Small MVP Trial)

## Goal
Evaluate if NeuroAid AI’s signals are understandable, actionable, and respectful of privacy in a real classroom workflow.

## Participants
- Small group (5–15 students) with parent/guardian consent
- Teacher + reading specialist (if available)

## Materials
- Headphones/mic or quiet corner
- Device with browser access
- Approved prompt set

## Procedure (10–15 minutes per student)
1) Explain purpose: screening signals, not diagnosis
2) Get consent
3) Run 1–2 short prompt sets
4) Teacher reviews the summary report
5) Teacher notes:
   - Was the report understandable?
   - Did it match what they observe?
   - What was confusing or unhelpful?

## Outcomes to record (no personal data)
- Time per screening
- Usability rating (1–5)
- Which signals were helpful
- Recommended improvements

## Stop conditions
- Student discomfort or distress
- Poor audio conditions that cause repeated failures
- Any privacy concerns

## Reporting
Only share aggregated feedback. Do not store or publish raw audio or identifiable transcripts.
