# Ethics & Privacy

NeuroAid AI is an educational screening tool and is not a diagnostic system.

## Informed consent (minors)
Before recording or uploading audio of a minor, obtain consent from a parent/guardian and the school/teacher where applicable.

Suggested consent language:
“I understand this tool provides informational screening signals and is not a diagnosis. I consent to recording the student’s voice for the purpose of generating a screening report.”

## Data handling (MVP defaults)
- No permanent storage by default
- Audio and transcripts are processed in memory
- User can export a report locally (optional)
- No data is sent to third parties unless the user explicitly enables an API transcription mode

## Risks / limitations
- Speech recognition errors can produce false signals
- Dyslexia is complex; screening signals are not definitive
- Dialect, multilingualism, speech disorders, anxiety, and environmental noise can affect results
- This tool should not be used for high-stakes decisions

## Bias mitigation (practical steps)
- Provide clear disclaimers in UI
- Encourage repeated attempts in a calm setting
- Offer multilingual prompt options in future versions
- Evaluate performance across varied accents and speech rates

## Compliance notes (high-level)
- COPPA/FERPA considerations: avoid storing personally identifiable audio data
- Keep pilot runs anonymous where possible
- Use aggregated metrics for any research write-ups
